## Gaussian Image Classifier

A useful text for INF4300 and INF9305 Digital Image Processing. Describes the multivariate Gaussian Discrimiant function that is required in the course for the purposes of image classificiation.

The accompanying Matlab code implements the Univariate and Multivariate Gaussian Classifier. First you call the Trainer and then feed that to the Classifier.
